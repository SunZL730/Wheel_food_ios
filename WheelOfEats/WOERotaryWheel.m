                          @"Goat cheese has fewer calories than cowâs cheese at only 75-103 calories per ounce. It is also easier to digest because it has less lactose and a different protein structure than cowâs milk. The taste of goat cheese has been likened to cream cheese and is considered to be saltier than feta. Fresh goat cheese should look moist. Â Reject if air-bloated, moldy, or leaking whey. Fresh artisan goat cheeses are not usually aged, so they are fresh and creamy looking with a fairly mild, salty flavor; Pairs well with a Sauvignon Blanc.",
                          @"The coloring in yellow cheddar was added to distinguish where the cheese was made. Cheddar Cheeses made in the New England states (including Cabot Cheddar Cheese made in Vermont) traditionally do not contain color additives. It is common for some moisture to develop inside the package of naturally produced Cheddar cheese. Syneresis allows Cheddar cheese to reach the next stage of aging giving it a sharp crumbly texture; Pairs best with a Malbec; Cheddar cheese pairs with a Cabernet Sauvignon; 113 calories per ounce.",
                          @"Gouda is named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. Gouda is typically made from pasteurised cowâs milk although some artisan varieties use sheepâs or goatâs milk to age them for a long time. American versions are smoother and less flavourful. Young Goudas pair well with beer, medium cheeses pair with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. Aged Goudas pair best with Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.",
                          @"Brie and Camambert are very similar in texture and color and both are originally from France.  The cheesemaking technique is similar except Brie Cream is added to Brie and not to the Camembert. Traditional French Brie and Camembert are made with raw milk outside the US. However, the USDA requires that all cheese made with raw milk be aged 60 days before being sold in US. Therefore American versions are always made with pasteurized milk. Camembert has more intense, deeper earthy notes than the milder and buttery Brie. Also a wheel of Camembert is much smaller, so it always sold in whole 8oz wheels. Brie wheels on average are 9-14in. in diameter. Because of this they are often sold in pie-shaped slices. Both pair well with Pinot Noir, while Brie may also pair with a Chardonnay; 95 calories per ounce.",
                          @"Manchego cheeseÂ is a sheep's milk cheese from Spain that contains an inedible rind.Â The crosshatched appearance in the rind comes from the basket it was aged in. The rind is typically wrapped in black wax, revealing a creamy white to pale yellow cheese inside. It adds a salty, nutty flavor to dishes. Because of a sheepâs diet, having notes of herbs and plants are also common in the final product depending on the age. It is sold in 3 various stages, as a Fresco when aged for 2 months, a Curado when aged for 1 year, and Anejo when aged for 2 years. Look for brands with La Mancha origin on the label for authentication; Pairs well with a Rioja Wine.",
                          @"GruyÃ¨re is a hard yellow cheese, named after the town of GruyÃ¨res in Switzerland. It is a smooth-melting type of swiss cheese that's made from whole cow's milk and generally cured for 6 months or longer. Also like the swiss cheese, it has holes created by the gas bubbles released by the bacteria used in making the cheese. However it is slightly nutty in taste, and makes a great melting cheese, wonderful for fondue. The water-to-fat ratio, and curdling with enzymes called rennet is what enables it to melt. Keep in mind that the longer a cheese is aged, the more it dries out. Younger fresher cheeses will melt better than aged cheeses; Pairs well with Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc.",
                          @"Burrata is made from Mozzarella but it is NOT a Mozzarella. After making Mozzarella, the cheese is formed into a pouch, and then filled with soft, stringy curd called stracciatella and cream. The outer shell remains a solid Mozzarella, but its center is a milky, buttery flavor that's rich without being too indulgent; hence its name Burrata, which literally translates into 'buttered.' After slicing into the ball of cheese, the creamy filling will be revealed, often spilling onto the plate. For the most flavor and best texture, bring burrata up to room temperatureÂ before serving; should be eaten as fresh as possible. When burrata has gone bad, the flavor is sour and it will smell like old milk. Pairs best with a Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin blanc, and Pinot Gris.",
